# Nested Mutations

When creating or updating nodes, you can connect it to an existing related node or create a new related node that will be connected as well.

### Nested Create Mutations

For every relation of a type, the `update` and `create` mutations expose an argument to issue a nested create operation on the related type. Depending on the relation multiplicity, this argument allows to either create a single related node (for to-one relations) or multiple related nodes (for to-many relations).

### Nested Connect Mutations

For every relation of a type, the `update` and `create` mutations expose an argument to connect the original node to an existing related node. Depending on the relation multiplicity, this argument allows to either add a single related node (for to-one relations) or multiple related nodes (for to-many relations) to the relation.
